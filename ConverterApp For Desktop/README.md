## You can find the Windows Installer for the app here:

Please keep in mind, that its version 0.1. Any feedpback will be appreciated.

All the steps on how to find the converted files and the uploaded PDFs are in the "After Installation" steps.

## Information about the app:
The app is currently an early version of what it should be.
Once you run the app the console will be opened. I've made it this way so in case of any errors you can provide them here as a feedback.

### What formats does the app support:
Currently the app supports only PDF file and converts them to Excel.
An optimization for larger files will be added soon.

## How does the app work?
Once you run the app it will open a host server on your device (Currently supported only for Windows), so it can run the web app.
As the first idea of the app was it being a web application, I decided to continue with the idea and not re-write it for Windows.
When you see the console, please give it a minute or two till the app window appears.

## In case you skip the steps after installation!
You can find all of the uploaded PDFs and converted files in folder "Uploads".
The folder will be created automatically, in case it's missing from your system.
